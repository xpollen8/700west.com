				<p>
In the early 70’s my band, Stone's Crossing, was looking for a place to record some of our original tunes. We didn’t have a lot to spend, and we found 700 West Studios through a classified ad in the paper. We went out one Sunday afternoon to the old farmhouse to have a look, introduced first to a three-year old blond kid painting a cat bright yellow on the couch with poster paint. It turned out to be an auspicious entry into the slightly askew realm of Moe Whittemore - inventor, composer, musician, and wizard-in-residence. For the next few years we became regulars at the studio, recording, mixing, and sometimes just hanging out, but always amused - and occasionally exasperated - by the antics and escapades of its proprietor.
</p>
<p>
Moe had been a successful engineer with RCA, but left in order to pursue his dream of recording local artists. It’s hard to believe, but Indianapolis actually had a thriving community of musicians and composers at one time, long ago killed off by the homogenizing toxin of loud corporate radio and properly-coiffed small-dicked producers. Moe was there from the beginning, and his home-styled discount facility provided many of us opportunities we never would have had otherwise. During our tenure some of us sold a few songs and records, and a few of us were signed to national recording contracts. Some did better than others, but each of us benefitted from Moe’s unique talents and personality.
</p>
<p>
For example, he wasn’t above including his own production choices in a mix, whether we wanted it or not. He was never loathe to hide his opinions of a tune or performance, but went to great lengths to work with artists he thought worth the effort. He elevated flatulence to a performance art, the glint of mischief in his eye ever-present. It gleamed especially when he’d caught you in one of his practical jokes.
</p>
<p>
I showed up for a vocal session one afternoon, and he pointed to a grocery bag in the control room.
</p>
<p>
“That’s for you,” he said, deadpan.
</p>
<p>
“Oh?” I replied. “A gift?” I picked the heavy-ish bag up and peered inside, my eyes adjusting. I bellowed as the unmistakable shapes of a couple dozen severed chicken feet became clear, mixing with their metallic clammy smell.
</p>
<p>
“What the hell?” I shrieked as I threw the bag down.
</p>
<p>
“Yeah,” he guffawed. “We butchered a bunch of chickens this morning. I kept those for you.”
</p>
<p>
And he had. I don’t know why. I certainly didn’t want them and made him get rid of them before the session started. But that was life working with the mad carnival-clown genius at 700 West.
</p>
<p>
Eventually our paths diverged and after twelve years the studio closed down. Moe still contacts me from time-to-time. He called last week and sent me a CD of some of his most recent compositions. He’s still amazing and full of hilarious, eccentric fire. My life was incalculably brightened by its blaze…chicken feet and all.

My nephew was bummed that he had the 45 in with the ones he gave to the record shop. Dave and I just were FB messaging last weekend laughing at the 45 & Ebay. Here is what Dave messaged:  'That was so cool going to 700 West. Those were the days.'  And they were!!! As you remember, we were going to have the one 45 with two songs on it, one from Scofield and the other from Toffolo, but we had so much fun recording Clare's Song for Side-A, that we decided to put John's song on another 45's Side-A and wrote Poor Johnny the night before (and during) the recording of it.  It was a blast.  We never got around to coming back to 700 West to record the second 45 due to College schedules and such... But 700 West was fun.`,

Finally, after watching her struggle with it for awhile, one of the other contestants offered to loan her his guitar. Guess who?  She beat 'em, too.  Mike's group came in second.  Mike ended up winning Sally, though, a couple of years after that first meeting.  (That sounds so romantic I bet you think I made that all up - well it's the Gothic novel truth!)`,

Here we have a LIMITED PRESS LP (200 COPIES ONLY) released in 1976 by
multi-talented 700 West producer (and all around nice guy) Maurice "Moe" J.
Whittemore, Jr. entitled "Mo - First Album".
</p>
<p>
This album is on (what else?) 700
West Records (catalog number 760704 STEREO). 700 West Studios & Moe
Whittemore are from the heart of the midwest, Indianapolis, Indiana (New
Palestine to be exact) and have been recognized the world over for such projects
as ZERFAS (a 1973 psych monster), PRIMEVIL (a hardrock guitar driven
classic) MODLIN/SCOTT, AMNESTY (soul/funk), BUCCANEER,
MICHAEL HENDERSON and many more too numerous to mention!
</p>
<p>
This is a
tuff album to find, and even tougher to define musically... but 'll try! It really
has to be heard to be believed! First off, Moe pressed this limited edition lp as
"A Collection Of Publisher's Demos" as he calls it... and oh my brother... is it
all around the board!! All material is credited to M. Whittemore as
writer/composer. Moe plays all keyboads on the LP, including a home-built
synthesizer that'll mess up your mind, electric oboe, and we're also treated to
Moe's vocal styings as well... shades of Robert Wyatt definitely come to mind
when Moe takes lead vocal!!
</p>
<p>
We are also treated to a cool R&B flavored track
entitled "Make A Little Wine" (one of Moe's hobbies - to the delight of most
everyone who had the privilege of gracing the 700 West studios through the
years) featuring the ZERFAS brothers, David & Herman on drums & lead
vocals respectively. By the way, the open drum break that starts the track off is
to die for! Another fun note is that all cover art is credited to Mookie, Goog,
Busk & Boo (Moe's then young children), and in turn, all Moe's children are
then credited to his wife Betty (nice touch, Moe!). Get ready for everything
from avant-garde electronica to a soul/funk-psych freakout, and all points in
between!!!
</p>
<p>
final bid: $122.50

Moe Whittemore's first and only album on his own 700 West label is one of
Indiana's oddest left-field rarity. Ostensibly a selection of publishers demos,
the album was rumored to have been printed in a very small run of only 300
copies.
</p>
<p>
The style runs the gamut from beat-heavy progressive rock on
"Nowhere To Go" and "Slammer" to futuristic space noodlings on "K2- 3rd
Movement".  "Congratulations" is sounds like a lost Pink Floyd out-take from
Dark Side of the Moon. The final track on side A -- Muscle Pumpkin is  thinly
veiled ode to Captain Beefheart -- sounding like a Trout Mask Replica attack
complete with choral background singers and Ornette Coleman oboe
(courtesy Mo).
</p>
<p>
The flip is dominated by more "normal" songs, including
drum-heavy "Make a Little Wine" which saw some local airplay as a 45 rpm
release back in 1976. It begins with a monstrous break-beat that sounds like
bong-smoking noises in the background. Two country songs follow. Anthony
Black of Lamp Records fame (Tony Black and the Revolution) provides vocals
on the sweet soul masterpiece of Indianapolis -- "Check Me Out." Absolutely
sickening!!
</p>
<p>
All in all, the album is something between a demo to promote his
recording studio and a library record of styles. Absolutely recommended to
beat heads, library collectors and psych fans.

				title: `The Amazing MO's First Album from 1976 -- highly recommended!`,
				body: `
<p>
This astonishing album is the creation of &nbsp;a relatively unknown genius named&nbsp;Moe Whittemore, who also founded the studio 700 West in New Palestine Indiana. &nbsp;Notice they released the 1976 Sailor album I <a href="http://progressreview.blogspot.ca/2015/07/the-other-sailor-band-i-mentioned.html" target="_blank">featured recently this summer</a>, plus other famous unknown progressive gems. &nbsp;That Maelstrom Paradigm album from them, for those who have heard it (I don't actually recommend it) is absolute atonal progressive noncommerciality, showing the artistic dedication of this particular studio head.
</p>
<p>
But back to his first album. &nbsp;As a whole this record features creativity at such a high level of unique progressiveness that I wouldn't hesitate to say it's the best music I've heard in the last year in this department, &nbsp;<i>exceeding Tom's <a href="http://progressreview.blogspot.ca/2015/08/toms-metaphysical-animation-from-1973.html" target="_blank">Metaphysical Animation</a> discovery</i> in advanced compositional skills -- &nbsp;at least with regards to side a, <i>beta</i> being quite a bit more uneven. &nbsp;(Note the title of the former: <i>sic sum,</i> or thus I am. &nbsp;Whereas the second is <i>sic simulare sum -- </i>thus I pretend to be?)
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the whole thing was made available for mp3 download by the artist on <a href="/release/Mo-First_Album.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;this page.</a>&nbsp; In 2014 it was released as a vinyl reissue of about 200 copies as you can see on <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Mo-First-Album/release/6928674" target="_blank">discogs.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;The original album from 39 years ago, probably present in this world only in a few remnant copies, would probably fetch quite a high price... &nbsp;Here's the excellent review from discogs, edited:
</p>
<p>
<i>"Moe Whittemore's first and only album on his own 700 West label is one of Indiana's oddest left-field rarity.

</p>
<p>
Oh yes, it's absolutely recommended, all right! &nbsp;As he intimated there are a couple of throwaway tracks (to me) including the song about making wine (a side occupation of Mo's apparently, probably within the studio). &nbsp; For me the song "<i>Congratulations"</i> just takes it over the top with Zappaesque humour and satirical lyrics, far exceeding the tongue in cheek of <a href="http://progressreview.blogspot.ca/2015/08/brustna-illusioner-swedish-treasure.html" target="_blank">Brustna's</a> similarly themed song (<i>Stupid Record Company</i>) about commercial success (or Pink Floyd's <i>Welcome to the Machine</i> from 1978's <i>Wish you Were Here</i>). &nbsp;Pay attention to the spoken voice saying near the end: &nbsp;<i>"That's probably one of the best songs out there right now!" </i>and the silly deejay voices: <i>"REO Speedwagon!!" &nbsp;</i>But all the lyrics are well worth discerning here.

</p>
<p>
That high pitched instrument that sounds like a bagpipe, I take it, is the oboe mentioned by the reviewer.
</p>
<p>
Or try to follow the sheer bizarreness of the melody of track 10, "<i>A little While:"</i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/audio/Mo_FirstAlbum/mo_10_a_little_while.mp3" target="_blank">https://700west.com/audio/Mo_FirstAlbum/mo_10_a_little_while.mp3</a>
</p>
<p>
Now that's the kind of song I wish I could hear on the radio or at work!! &nbsp;When you consider that this is ostensibly a sentimental love song, imagine how appealing it would have been for the poor receiving female to hear, especially when it transforms half way through into an uptempo jazz improvisation. &nbsp;Utterly demented.
</p>
<p>
This is what I love, these wacky, <i>out there</i>, utterly creative artists, like Karlos Steinblast or <a href="http://progressreview.blogspot.ca/2014/07/sandoz-pay-attention-from-1971-released.html" target="_blank">Sandoz,</a> who are saying f--- you to the art establishment that attempts at all times to dictate, control or throttle into conventional shapes what is art and what is not-- when it is the human heart that is the sole and absolute arbiter on that subject...
</p>
<p>
In the near future I'm going to post another very rare, very expensive item, that absolutely blew me away when I heard it, both because it's unknown even among collectors, and because of the utter beauty of the complex compositions...<br/>
stay tuned for that one...
</p>
<i>no the search will never end...</i>

Having read a few things at your web page, I guess that even the whole edition of Issue 8 of TimeMazine would be too 'little' to include all of your 'Work And Days' from the mid 30s when you were born (1934) till nowadays (summer 2013). So, we will focus in this remarkable period of the 700west recording studio (1972-1983). Readers can of course learn more by going to your web page.

<hr/>
<p>
<u>
Let me start by asking if you had any musical background prior to 700west?
</u>
</p>
<p className="moe">
It seems like I've always been involved with music - 'on the side'.  It started with piano lessons at age 8 thru 17.  Clarinet & oboe lessons started in high school, then on into the Purdue band.  In '58, while working full time at my money gig (Electronic Engineering), I tried for my bMusic on oboe.  But there was an engineering job change, so I left the Indy area with about 20 credit hours to go on the degree.  (More on that, later....)
</p>
<p> <u>
OK. So, how did it all start with the recording studio?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
Thru the '60s tho, my engineering jobs were music related: speaker and audio electronics design at GM; studio monitor speaker, capacitor mic and recording console design at RCA.  Having to demo this equipment to the various RCA studios gave me the chance to observe some great recording sessions.  I then realized 'I can do this'!  Additionally, all thru the '60s I was involved with field/live recording projects that used my highly modified tape system.  Anyway, I left RCA in '72 and opened 700 West Recording.  Our earliest equipment included a modified older Magnecorder PT6H equipped with multiple heads (including a 4-channel stack) using my own electronics and a couple of my homemade capacitor mics, supplemented by a few commercial dynamic mics.  We were on our way!!
</p>
<p> <u>
How did you decide to run a recording studio? (When, where, why, how...)
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
There were a few large, pricey studios in the Indy area (that specialized mostly in commercials), but few of the startup bands could afford this luxury.  From the outset, 700 West was to cater to these small groups by specializing in the demo tape (and occasional vinyl release) and keeping things affordable.  As time wore on tho, a trend emerged.  Nearly all the material done by our 'clients' were their original tunes!  Hardly any cover tunes were ever recorded! (It's just as well, since one more version of 'Smoke On the Water' was enough to make one puke!!)  In the beginning - to keep afloat - I also did instrument repairs and built custom electronic goodies for our groups.
</p>
<p> <u>
Which was the first demo you cut? I believe it was Mr. Feelgood's single? (Tell us a few things about that)
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
Actually, I can't remember the group's name on our 1st demo tape gig, but shortly after that, Russell Peck and Kurt Carpenter did a demo (a lot of parody stuff) with their group 'The Competition, Inc.'  Russell went on to be a great classical music composer and teacher, and Kurt had just been awarded ASCAP's 'Young Composer of the Year' award!  (David Bowie's wife attended a few of their sessions....)  Before 'Mr. Feelgood's' single, we cut a 45 for Dean Wolfe and his 'By Chantz Operation'.  Finally, we get to the Mr. Feelgood sessions.  His backup band was the club group 'The Demonstrators'.  Fun band, but always loaded.  Never showed up when they were supposed to.  This single got some airplay on a couple local Indy stations in '72.
</p>
<p> <u>
The Zerfas! I believe that this was your first original release, right? Tell us, about the Zerfas brothers, their album, the recording sessions, anything that you can remember (if possible).
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
The Zerfas LP was the 1st LP release on the 700 West label, although we did a couple of gospel LPs just before it - on one of which Dave Zerfas played drums!  Dave was the group leader and Herman (Brian) was the versatile keyboardist, vocalist - you name it!  We also used Dave and Herman a bit as studio musicians....   The album was recorded between 1/25/73 and 7/11/73, with time out in the middle to re-think some of the ideas they were doing.  When recording resumed, things went along pretty quickly!  I believe the initial pressing was for 500 albums, with a re-order of 300.  Right before the Zerfas sessions I acquired our 3M 4-track mastering machine, and finished up the infamous 'orange boxes' - our 1st tri-amped studio monitors.  Since they were a road band, Zerfas/Jubal came back quite a few times to update some of their material to fit the current trends.  They were among the last groups to record with us, before we closed in '83.  Their last thing was a re-do of 'The Piper', my fattest production, ever!!  It rivaled 48-track recordings of the day!!
</p>
<p> <u>
There's a lot experimentation going on the Zerfas album. Did you play a role?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
I suppose I encouraged them to experiment.  Backwards reverb & vocals; processed belches; speed change & ring modulator effects - things like that....  Since they were Beatles-influenced, they dared compare me to George Martin (I wish!).  But if they could describe another weird electronic effect they wanted, I tried to come up with it.
</p>
<p> <u>
I think that you did engineering on all of your recording sessions, right? 
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
Yeah.  Except one time when we needed extra hands during an album mix to continuously correct an out-of-tune singer by riding his vocal using the Harmonizer.
</p>
<p> <u>
You did an excellent job on 'Smokin' Bats' by Primevil. What can you remember from the Primevil days?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
I always let our rock clients 'turn up' in the studio, just like they did playing live gigs - made all the difference in the world in their sound and attitude!  Primevil was a real fun group to work with.  Sometimes we had to cut a session short because our sides hurt from laughing so hard....  I guess I tried to find a 'signature' sound by our groups and push to get 'more of it' - if it made me feel good or laugh!  The great guitar leads by Jay & Larry, the funky drumming by Mel and Jay's great 8-measure screams come to mind....
</p>
<p> <u>
Jay of Primevil told me that you are a great guy but crazy as a raving mad scientist.  'Moe brought the band to a whole new place with some of his production ideas'. And your particular recording techniques I may add. Would you like to give us an example of your 'techniques'?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
'Raving, mad scientist' - hardly.  Just a normal Electronics Engineer with a bit of a musical background....  I may've suggested the stomping bit on 'High Steppin' Stomper', but Jay dragged the stage in to stomp on!  Jay's acapella guitar solo over the stomping was something I remembered that B. B. King did at a concert, stamping on the stage.  The album was 'mutually produced', other than my prodding the group to 'do more of this, or that' - or, 'get out of the chord, dammit'!!
</p>
<p> <u>
Scott And Modlin! Comments?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
This was a '75/'76 effort.  By then, we'd gotten our 8-channel master recorder and our Neumann U-47 Mic.  Working with the 'storytellers' Dave Scott and Dan Modlin was a world different from working with Primevil!  The direction of their LP-to-be was pretty much dictated by their manager Mike Griffin.  I just tried to record them as cleanly as I could, and correct minor clams.  I also played a bit of piano for 'em (and shot my .44 cap & ball revolver on 'McCall').  But there's one tune on the album that I had a musical say on  - 'I've Seen Your Face'.  We used my synth's pitch-to-voltage converter to track Dan's bass and automatically inject synthesizer bass underneath.  This tune also has a highly compressed acoustic guitar solo - unusual sounds for a Newgrass rocker!  (Dan & Dave are still strong in music, currently piecing together a new album!)
</p>
<p> <u>
Would you mind telling us a few things about some of the other bands/artists that stepped through your door? And maybe tell us who impressed you most and why? 
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
Jeez!  I learned something from every band that graced our portals!  (And tried to apply this to other groups that came thru - cross breeding, you might say...)  Some of the highlites might include: Ezekial Longspur, Zerfas, Stonewall, Stone's Crossing, anything Jim Dicks did, Amnesty, Malachi, J. Michael Henderson, Ebony Rhythm Funk Campaign, Kevin Stonerock, Funk St. Workshop, the Beatsters, Port Orange (Versietyle), John Kimsey and the Art Thieves, Rex Thomas,  the Wright Brothers, Blakey Special, J.D. Redmon, Golden Grass, Jerry Lowe, Long Yang, Maelstrom.  I could go on and on, as I loved and learned from each of 'em....  All were talented musicians and their bands were very tight - and open to suggestions!
</p>
<p> <u>
Is there a favorite recording act of yours from the 700west era? Or maybe one that you enjoyed working with?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
(See above...)
</p>
<p> <u>
Engineer, Mix, Production, Technical Advisor, Musical Advisor, Synthesizer, Piano, Oboe, Vocals. Which is your favorite role?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
I can't separate these roles, as all overlap - and all are who I am!
</p>
<p> <u>
You have worked closely with nearly 2000 individuals from 3 to 300 hours each. Can you name all the musical styles/genres that went through your recording studio?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
Good lord!  How 'bout: Hard Rock, Country Rock, Funk, R & B, White Gospel, Black Gospel, Country (very little), Alternative, Big Band, Bluegrass, an occasional spec commercial by one of our groups, Jazz (rarely, as jazz groups didn't record much), Asian ethnic, spoken word recordings for NPR, solo Classical audition demos - and pop-oriented tunes for hopeful pre-teen contest prospects!!
</p>
<p> <u>
You recorded a bunch of great singles! Comments?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
So far as the vinyl output goes, we probably did more singles than LPs.  They were far more affordable to the groups who needed records to sell at their gigs.
</p>
<p> <u>
Tell us about your one and only solo album released in 1976. Is it an odd selection of demos trying to show the abilities of you and your studio, as they say? Musically it covers so many styles/genres! Who takes part? How many copies were pressed?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
The 'Mo, First Album' was a collection of demos that I was shopping around to publishers.  Some of my acquaintances talked me into cutting an album from these tunes.  Mercifully, only 200 LPs were released.  Surprisingly, some of the tunes were picked up!  Even more surprising, some of the stuff got airplay!  Most of the material was an application of a certain musical composition technique, ex: 'Check Me Out' was a study in the 'cycle of fifths' chord progression; 'Congratulations' was a progressive rocker in 5/4 time; 'Muscle Pumpkin' was a collage of crazy snippets recorded at the studio, etc., etc.  I do quite a bit of playing on the album, as well as some solo and backup singing - but I had plenty of outside help!  Some of the lead vocals featured Herman (Brian) Zerfas; ERFCs Tony Black; Amnesty's Herman Walker; and the Johnson Brothers Bill Johnson.  Drumming duties were shared by Dave Zerfas, Gary Brewer and Michael Black.  Guitarists/bassists include Rex Thomas, Dave Lovell, Larry Lucas, Bo Gooliak and Pat Johnson.  Some of the players were members of the Zerfas and Primevil groups.
</p>
<p> <u>
Who is to blame about having recorded many records that sell amongst collectors for hundreds of dollars? Was it the corn? (joking)
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
(Probably the soy beans!  HA!!)  All kidding aside, most of these bands were truly great - and never got the break they should've, before 'The Recession' of the late 70s caught up with the Music business....  If 700 West stuff is desirable, it's because we chose our 'label bands' carefully and believed in them and their material!  And most of their recordings have aged very well sonically, sounding great alongside current releases!!
</p>
<p> <u>
Anything last to add?
</u> </p>
<p className="moe">
After my Engineering career was winding down, I went back to school and got my Master's degree in Music Composition from Butler Univ. in 2005.  (You ain't lived until you've taken the GRE exam at age 70!)  What's left of the old studio has been converted back into a home.  The old control room now houses my 'project studio'.  I wish I had some of my current digital goodies, back in the day!  I'm now trying to 'sell' my classical compositions.  Sadly, it's no better now, than when I was trying to sell my Pop/Rock/Funk comps, back in the 70s!!  
Cheers!!!

Moe Whittemore of 700 West records
<p>
Behind every great music scene, there's a cultural revolutionary. Not necessarily a musician - it could be a label boss, a producer or disc jockey - someone with a far-reaching musical vision that extends beyond established paradigms and parameters, eclipsing the provincial values of a local scene to open up exciting musical frontiers.
</p>
<p>
Jamaica had Lee "Scratch" Perry. In the 1970s, the producer plunged reggae music into new sonic realms. Mixing found sounds over dub beats, Perry's music pulsed with an experimental fervor.
</p>
<p>
More recently, one could point to Mad Decent's Diplo. The DJ/producer's playful aesthetic and open ear for fresh sounds injected a much-needed dose of adventurous fun into an electronic music scene that had become far too serious and staid.
</p>
<p>
In the 1970s, central Indiana had its own musical visionary: Moe Whittemore, whose 700 West recording studio became a musical destination for local musicians seeking top quality demos. From new wave rock to big band jazz, Whittemore documented the sound of Indianapolis, no matter how mundane or avant-garde.
</p>
<p>
Whittemore opened 700 West in 1972, converting the living room of his New Palestine, Indiana home into a recording facility. Whittemore's keen musical instincts and background in electronic engineering separated 700 West from the average small town studio. Every musician that visited 700 West benefitted from Whittemore's extraordinary musical imagination and arsenal of homemade equipment.
</p>
<p>
Impressed with the quality of original local music he'd been recording, Whittemore expanded his operation into a record label in 1973. The catalog of music Moe recorded and released at 700 West never achieved platinum status. But it eventually made its way across the globe, finding an international audience with connoisseurs of underground rock and funk.
</p>
<p>
"Among collectors, 700 West is known for both high quality recordings and historically significant releases, especially 1970s rock." said former Missing Link Records owner Rick Wilkerson. Rick's tenure dealing rare psych-rock vinyl at Missing Link has earned him respect as an authority on the topic.
</p>
<p>
"Although they were just a little spot on a country road in New Palestine, records by Zerfas, Primevil and many others released on the label are highly prized by fans around the world," said Wilkerson.
</p>

</p>
<p>
So what made 700 West so special and how did this "little spot on a country road" produce a handful of LPs that continually attract worldwide attention from collectors?
</p>
<p>
Certainly, credit must be attributed to the quality of musicians that entered 700 West. The studio hosted some of Indy's best bands in the 1970s, from the jazzy hard funk of Amnesty to the pre-metal stoner rock of Primevil.
</p>
<p>
<iframe width="550" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BV8cDjykhug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>
But, ultimately it was Whittemore's openness to new musical ideas that made the best releases on the label so unique. Whittemore was eager to help each group attain their singular musical vision, no matter how complex the process might be.
</p>
<p>
That trait is best displayed on the 1973 self-titled release by Zerfas. The album finds Whittemore playing George Martin to Zerfas' Beatles, employing a variety of production wizardry, from odd sound effects and reversed vocals to primitive electronics.
</p>
<p>
I solicited the opinion of noted psychedelic music scholar and author Stan Denski, who called the LP "the Sgt. Pepper of the Midwest." Denski elaborated, "it's basically a gifted teen age band in a studio with limited technology, using every trick in the book to craft a record that offers surprises with every passing second."
</p>
<p>
<iframe width="550" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EWI3C1V_f2g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>
Although much of 700 West's reputation rests on the legacy of its rock output, Whittemore was equally at home recording funk and soul. Recent years have yielded high profile reissues of this work, including a lost album of material from Amnesty.
</p>
<p>
All of these varied influences come together on Whittemore's 1976 solo LP First Album, my favorite release in the 700 West canon. With jazzy space rock jams, (featuring Moe's one of a kind oboe work) and Eno-esque synthesizer experiments colliding with sweet soul ballads and country rock, First Album is as eclectic as Whittemore himself.
</p>
<p>
<iframe width="550" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9ugeuD87ns4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>
Curious to know more about Whittemore, I made a pilgrimage to visit the producer at his New Palestine home. Whittemore still lives on the same country farm that housed the 700 West studio.
</p>
<p>
Moe and his wife Betty welcomed me into their home and graciously endured my persistent questioning, as they gave me a tour of the living room studio that gave birth to some of the greatest moments in Hoosier rock history.
</p>
<p>
I was excited to learn that Moe still makes music, mostly composing. In fact, Whittemore completed a masters course in music composition at Butler in 2005.
</p>
<p>
As we spoke, Moe cued up a recording of a recent composition. It was a symphonic work and the strings and brass were bolstered by a heavy funk backbeat. As I listened, it crossed my mind that at nearly 80 years old, Whittemore is still a music visionary, still pursuing new sounds and new musical frontiers.

<h3>Welcome, #listeningclub'ers!</h3>
We hope you were able to enjoy the "Mo" album.
</p>
<p>
Here's the backgrounder for what you heard.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/moeshot_1976.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
My father, Maurice (Moe) Whittemore, Jr
quit the corporate life in 1972 and used his electronic engineer degree
knowledge to build a recording studio in our rural farmhouse home 20 miles east of Indianapolis, Indiana.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/house_500.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
700 West Recording Studios.
</p>
<p>
Imagine musicians approaching this scene for the first time! (... that's the studio..?)
</p>
<p>
He built much of the original <a href='/equipment'>equipment</a>: condenser microphones,
amplifiers, speaker systems, plate reverb, a modular 4-channel mixing
console with mic pre-amps and compressors, a 12 oscillator analog
synthesizer - all of his own design!
</p>
<p>
The walls of our front room were covered with fibreglass bags
for sound treatment.  The wall to the den off the front room had a hole
punched in it for a window, and the den became the control room.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/studio_1976.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I grew up around, and considered normal the constant flow of characters,
the midnight guitar solos, the hammond organ lesie now and again blocking
the stairwell (best acoustics), and we had to limit typical family
activities during acoustic or vocal sessions.  Bringing inner-city funk
bands into the sanctuary of our rural home/studio felt like a subversive act.
</p>
<p>
My father has been called the "George Martin of Central Indiana".
His crazy "have you considered..?" attitude, paired with his formidable
technical abilities led to innovative results, and he encouraged the acts
to stretch and explore. At least two of these artists later
<a href="/tributes">wrote their own songs</a> about their experiences with my father and
their time in the studio! That's high praise.
</p>
<p>
Before it closed after 12 years, 700 West released 25 albums and as many singles - with some of the most creative production around.
All are highly collectible.
</p>
<p>
The Zerfas LP? Over $1,000. Primevil? Getting close to $500.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/covers/mo_front.jpg" width="500" />
</p>
<p>
The "Mo" album is a showcase of my father's songwriting, his production skills,
and is powered by players from bands who had been studio customers. My father cherry picked musicians - country, funk, rock, jazz, gospel - whoever was good.
</p>
<p>
Side A (Sic Sum) is experimental, synth-heavy, with electric oboe, complex harmonies, a bitter song about the music biz, and an extraordinary cut-up piece featuring "random instrumentation, greater Indianapolis". Side B (Sic Simulara Sum) has slightly more traditional compositions featuring guest vocalists. The final track "A Little While" is a standout. Who says modes can't be catchy?
</p>
<p>
200 copies were pressed, and the sleeve features artwork by his children.
My "Muscle Pumpkin" lent his name to the most abstract track on
the album which consists entirely of razor-bladed tape samples.
</p>
<p>
If you're interested in a copy of the re-issue, you can find 'em
on ebay.
</p>
<p>
The Listening Club was ripped from the re-issue, which ends with the extra track "Wait 'Til Yesterday", an Eno-esque track produced nearer the end of the 700 West days.
</p>
<p>
At age 70, my father returned to graduate school at Butler University to complete the music degree had had started back in the 50's!  At age 83, he is working on 19-tone classical compositions - in the den of the same farmhouse 20 miles east of Indianapolis.
</p>
<p>
And the oboe? That's an early <a href="http://alaubin.com/" target="new">Laubin</a>

As I recall, Jay Wilfong was the person who first introduced me
to Moe and 700 West. I was immediately impressed
with the audio quality and I think the first cut I heard
out there was Ezekial Longspur's song about
"Rolling Down the Highway."  It sounded so good that
it was obvious this Whittemore guy knew what he was
doing...........
<p>
Shortly after that I played bass on a demo for
Bill Jackson and Tom Mobley at 700 West. Rex Thomas also
sat in on that one on steel. Jackson was a superb
vocalist, and I still think he was one of the best
I've ever been around........... Tom later got
involved with Sequoiah, but I don't know what
happened to Bill.......... He sang one song called
"The Death of the Circus with No Thanks to
Fellini" that I wish I could hear again............
Definitely good stuff............
</p>
<p>
I remember sitting on that little padded bench
Moe had by the window in the control room and
watching him work wonders. He was always
lighting up a fresh batch of tobacco in his pipe, and
his favorite past-time was making up humorous new lyrics for
our songs. We learned so much from him about mike placement
and ping-pong techniques for recording with limited tracks.
</p>
<p>
We were really blessed to have so much talent in that place.
The people who sat in on our album project were really
good. Obviously, Jerry De Rome and Jay Wilfong were
a tremendous help. Jim Moore, who was the steel
guitarist for Bill Wilson, did a great job. We couldn't
afford to pay the session players, but they just did it
because they wanted to record out there. Everybody did.
</p>
<p>
I remember I later tried to return the favor by playing
bass for some other artists there. I don't recall all of the
projects, but I do remember playing  on a single
or two for Ed Ott.
</p>
<p>
Moe invested a tremendous amount of time and patience in all
of us. He could fix so many problems. I had a strap button let
go  and my priceless Gibson J-50 fell on concrete one
night. You could have dropped a golf ball through the back of
it. Moe repaired it, and I ended up using it on the acoustic
lead break in "I've Seen Your Face."  I still use that old Gibson
for recording...............
</p>
<p>
700 West was such a unique place to record. You could hear
goats outside and smell Moe's coffee brewing inside. He had
a knack for putting you at ease with his sense of humor, and
that was really important---- especially the first few times
you saw that red recording light go on..........

				title: `A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT 700 WEST`,
				body: `
				<p>
I first met Moe in 1976. I had written several songs and was looking for 
someplace to do a demo. 
I knew that my classmate, Mel Cupp, had recorded an album there with 
Primevil, and I liked 
what I heard, so my friend Paul Herr and I decided to check it out.
</p>
<p>
I had never been in a real studio before, and that big farmhouse at the 
end of the lane sure didn't 
look like any I had imagined. We knocked on the door and were greeted by 
a tall, lanky fellow 
wearing a white V-neck t-shirt and fly away hair. We were invited inside 
and escorted to the 
control room where we arranged an appointment to do my first professional 
demo session.. an 
inauspicious beginning to what was to become a milestone in my life.
</p>
<p>
From the beginning, I always felt a sense of camaraderie at 700 West. Moe 
was not just the 
engineer, but also the producer, arranger, vocal coach (you haven't lived 
until you've witnessed 
Moe demonstrating a high harmony pad!), guitar tech, session player, 
publisher, promoter, and 
guidance counselor. Nobody's fool, I'm sure he saved many of us from 
being eaten alive by the 
industry sharks.
</p>
<p>
One of our favorite pastimes during recording session lulls was to come 
up with parodies of the 
popular songs of the day or whatever project was currently in the studio. 
No one could best Moe 
at this game. I used to feel sorry for the sensitive "artiste" types 
who's lyrics were sacred to 
them, because I knew that after about three listens, Moe would rework it 
into some uproariously 
bawdy parody (anybody remember the "many physicians" or "floating lily 
pads" lines? He still 
has insulting titles for most of my tunes. In later years, when producing 
projects for other artists, 
I've had to be careful not to fall into Moe's pattern in that regard. 
..some of those guys are way too serious!)
</p>
<p>
I spent a great deal of time at 700 West in the late seventies and early eighties and I can't 
remember not having fun. Moe, Betty, Bobbie, Maury, David and Mark all made me feel like 
part of the family, sharing their food and even putting me up for the night when the power 
steering belt broke on my 1970 Bel Air.
</p>
<p>
Here are afew things I learned from Moe:
</p>
<p>
1. If one of your kids messes up, send them all to bed, because "it's the army way!"
<br/>2. Kalamazoos really can sound like Marshall stacks!
<br/>3. Don't take yourself too seriously
<br/>4. There's always a way to fix it (but let's do it BEFORE we mix!)
<br/>5. Take care of your livestock. Goats got milk too. (This one in memory of Thor, the wonder horse)
<br/>6. Don't be a clock watcher
<br/>7. Overly busy rhythm parts just add clutter
<br/>8. The wonders of high-string guitar
<br/>9. The difference it makes when somebody believes in what you're doing
<br/>10. A lack of gadgetry can be overcome by creativity
<br/>11. I could be better than I thought I could be (thanks for the push)
<br/>12. Do it until its right
</p>
<p>
Since my days at 700 West, I have recorded or produced a fair number of albums and several 
hundred demos for myself and other writers all across the country. The roots for much of my 
production and recording work can be traced directly to what I learned from Moe.   Of all the 
projects I've been involved in, nothing surpasses the pride and satisfaction I take in my first LP, 
Day Before Tomorrow, on 700 West Records. There was just something special about those 
days when dreams were so alive and "the music mattered more than the bottom line".
</p>
<p>
Thanks Moe!
</p>
<p>
P.S. Oddly enough, about two weeks before I knew about Moe's website, I 
wrote a song about 
those days. Here are the lyrics:
</p>
<hr/>
<b>DREAMING AGAIN</b>
<p>
Copyright 1999 Kevin P. Stonerock (BMI)
</p>
`,
lyrics: `
Young man on a bridge with a stick in his hand
I wonder what ever happened to him?
It was a long time ago in a fairy tale land
Sometimes I wish I could go there 
again

When the songs we sang were real and they came from our souls
And the music mattered more than the bottom line
It was a lifetime ago but I remember it well
Late at night when I am all alone
Dreaming Again
Beneath this calm exterior lies a frantic man
Frightened by the things that he don't know
With dreams too wild for dreaming out loud
But every now and then I let them show

When I get out on the road with nothing but time
An echo from the past comes calling me
And the years just melt away until I find
That who I was is what I'll always be
When I'm dreaming again

Dreaming again

Sewing patches on my jeans or patches on my dreams
Either way the stitches come undone
Try to save them as you may, they soon fall away
And leave the threadbare remnant in the sun

But when I get out on the road with nothing but time
An echo from the past comes calling me 
And the years just melt away until I find
That who I was is what I'll always be
When I'm dreaming again

Dreaming again

<p>
Kevin Stonerock is sitting in the studios at WSMJ-FM, Greenfield,
listening to a tape of his song, &quot;A Little Late For Love."
</p>
<p>
His foot is tapping slightly as he stares at the reel-to-reel
tape deck, unembarrassed, he says, but not exactly at ease with a
critic sitting by his side.
</p>
<p>
The easy-going tune wasn't being aired,
although it has been at the 50,000-watt station and other suburban
radio outlets. Stonerock's problem is that he still is relatively
unknown in Indianapolis. Not that this town is a hotbed of nationally
known acts (Faith Band and who else?), but Stonerock would at least
like some attention in the Capital City.
</p>
<p>
&quot;That's been my trouble." confessed the 22-year-old Knightstown High
School graduate &quot;Getting people to listen to it in Indianapolis."
</p>
<p>
Stonerock's first and only album, &quot;Day Before Tomorrow" (700 West),
has been on the market since June and only recently started a slight
move in sales. If you go into a record store you may have to dig
around for the album, and Stonerock feels the placement is another
part of his problem.
</p>
<p>
&quot;I've had so many people come up to me and say they couldn't find
my album,&quot; related the singer-songwriter. "But there it is -
stacked away in the 'local' bin, which I think is unfair anyway.
You don't go to LA, and find Jackson Browne stuck in the 'local' bin.
</p>
<p>
&quot;It's unfair categorization. Automatically, somebody'll see 
that 'local' bin and say, 'H-m-m, no good,' It doesn't just happen
to me but to a lot or other 'local acts.'&quot;
</p>
<p>
Stonerock actually was not bitter about the situation. That would
be against his nature. He appears to be an easygoing,
make-no-waves person and that personality shows through his
easier-to-take musical style.
</p>
<p>
His modesty is so strong that he never once mentioned his
charitable contributions that last week earned him a certificate
of honor from Gov. Otis Bowen at a benefit concert at Greenfield
High School, Stonerock was the feature performer at the show, which
was trying to raise $28,000 for the high school band's trip to the
Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington.
</p>
<p>
He also never mentioned that he once staged a benefit concert to
raise money for Jimmy Kattau, a cancer victim at Greenfield Junior High.
</p>
<p>
He also failed to mention that customers at the Main Street Music
Store in Greenfield may request that a dollar from the sale of his
album go to the Greenfield band or to Michelle Gorman, a young
Carthage girl suffering from leukemia. Indirectly, this is money
out of Stonerock's pocket.
</p>
<p>
&quot;It's great to be able to do it," said Stonerock, slightly embarrassed
by the mention of these overlooked items. &quot;It makes me feel good"
</p>
<p>
Does Stonerock himself support local acts?
</p>
<p>
&quot;I've got all kinds of local albums," he answered, "'They are some of
my favorites, l can identify with them. You go into some club and see
some guy beating his brains out up there playing
a guitar and people sitting around drunk not really paying attention
and you gotta give the guy credit to stand up and take it.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Stonerock, who hails from Greensboro, has done very few club
performances in Indianapolis, but has performed at the Improvisation
Club In Hollywood as part of the Alternative Chorus Songwriters Showcase.
</p>
<p>
&quot;If l had to choose between writer or artist, the safest way to go would
be writer.&quot; reasoned Stonerock. "But l like to perform. I'm just not
used to it yet,&quot;
</p>
<p>
He is scheduled to perform March 13 prior to an Indiana Pacer game at
Market Square Arena, and he will play at the Vogue in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Stonerock started out as a bass player at age 16 playing in several
bands. He did all of the bass work on &quot;Day Before Tomorrow."  Rex
Thomas provided the steel guitar (which Stonerock noted makes the album
a little more country that he actually is), Paul Herr played drums and
Moe Whittemore was on keyboards, Stonerock wrote all the material for
the album and coproduced it with Herr and Whittemore.
&quot;I put it together myself after l was frustrated by all of the record
companies turning down the demo tapes. l felt like l had a good album's
worth of material.
</p>
<p>
&quot;My goal is a national record contract with national distribution on
a major label,&quot; revealed Stonerock, who has a Canadian label interested
in his writing ability. 'That's really what I'd like to shoot for.
But a lot of people tell me Indianapolis is a tough town to get started
in and l don't know why.
</p>
<p>
Moe Whittemore (who operates the 700 West
Recording Studios in New Palestine says there are &quot;more talented
musicians per square mile in Indianapoliss than anywhere else.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Is anyone out there listening?

"Day Before Tomorrow" is a calming, sometimes wistful, look at love.
The artist's influences show, and blended with his own developing
style, produce an album that is very easy to listen to.  The style
ranges from quiet "Morning Song" to the bouncy "Down The Pike Againa".
Standouts for radio play include "Two Candles" and "You Were Made to
Smile".
</p>
<p>
"Morning Song", to this writer, appears to be the album's best.  A
reflective song with some excellent lines (even rivers change their
courses), that improves with repeated listenings.  "Roads", the album's
closer, stretches out a bit too long at the end, but remains a clear,
interesting look at the music business.  I'm looking forward to
Stonerock's next effort, his personal style should be more defined and
the subject matter broader.  But in the meantime, "Day Before Tomorrow"
stands as a first effort of first rate quality.
</p>
<p>
Kevin Stonerock ... A Thoughtful Sound
</p>
<p>
"I need to get stuff out in the open and off my chest.  Sometimes, it
helps me forget.  I guess that's why I write", says Kevin Stonerock,
singer songwriter.  If you haven't heard Kevin's work, you're missing a
relaxed thoughtful musical jourmey.  With the release of Kevin's first
album, "Day Before Tomorrow", (700 West), the 22 year old artist stands
on the brink of an important career.
</p>
<p>
Stonerock, a Greensboro resident began learning bass guitar at 15.  He
quickly moved on to electric guitar and has since become accomplished
on harmonica, tuba, and baritone horn, although, the bass remains his
first love.  He now performs solo after stints with Commonwealth and
most recently, Blackfoot Canyon.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by Gordon Lightfoot, Neil Young and Don Maclean lyrically and
Credance Clearwater Revival musically, Kevin began composing and
performing his own songs.  "I love to play," he said.  "Sometimes you
and the audience build this rapport that's just great'  And when you
don't, well, there's not much you can do.  You just keep on playing and
giving all you've got."  He has had his share of uncomfortable moments.
Last year, minutes before an appearance on stage at Hollywood's
Improvisational Club, he lost all of his fingerpicks.  "I was in the
back alley behind the stage," he remebereed, "and it was very dark, I
guess they fell out of my case.  I had no choice but to get up there
and play without them.  It was my first experience without picks and I
haven't gone back to them since.  The sound is more intimate.  But I
didn't know that then and it was scary."
</p>
<p>
The album "Day Before Tomorrow", was recorded locally at Moe
Whittemore's 700 West Studios.  Stonerock played several instruments
himself and was aided by his best friend and former Blackfoot Canyon
co-member, Paul Herr.  Also performing on the album are Janet Hewitt
and former Write Brother, Rex Thomas, who also has a newly released
album.  Kevin is proud of his first effort.  His personal favorites are
"Morning Song" ("It's pretty personal.  I used to kind of clam up when
I'd try to play it."), "Two Candles", "Time", and "Roads".  The album
has received generous airplay on the outlying stations, rock and pop
and country alike.
</p>
<p>
Having concentrated on writing primarily, Kevin is preparing to enter
the club scene.  His goal is a national recording contract.  He is, of
course, continuing his writing and hopes to broaden himself lyrically.
</p>
<p>
"In the future, I'll probably move a little away from the love song
themes.  It helps get your insecurities worked out.  Then you're ready
to head in different dierctions."
</p>
<p>
Whatever direction he heads in, the future looks bright for Kevin
Stonerock.

Kevin Stonerock, a well known name in the Knightstown area, may become
a nationally known name sometime in the not too distant future.  A
talented musician, Kevin has produced and album which is now beginning
to sell and he has begun making personal appearances in the area.
</p>
<p>
He recently was a guest on the Jim Gerard Show and performed prior to
an Indiana Pacers game at Market Square Arena.  He also has appeared at
The Ground Round and The Vogue in Indianapolis
</p>
<p>
His first album "Day Before Tomorrow" was released in June and is now
beginning to move in sales.  The style ranges from quiet "Morning Star"
to the bouncy "Down The Pike Again".  All songs on the album are
original recordings, written by Stonerock and available at most major
stores at Indianapolis and Greenfield.
</p>
<p>
A 1974 graduate of Knightstown High School, he resides in Greensboro
with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Calr Stonerock.  He bagan learning bass
guitar at age 15.  He moved on to learn electric guitar and is also an
accomplished tuba, baritone horn and harmonica player.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by several well known musicians, Kevin began composing and
performing his own songs.  After performing with two bands,
Commonwealth and Blackfoot Canyon, he now performs solo.
</p>
<p>
Busy with his own career and giving music lessons four days a week at
the Main Street Music Store at Greenfield, Kevin still finds time to
devote to charitable causes.  he was recently presented with a special
award from Governor Otis Bowen on behalf of his charitable
contributions.  The award was presented at a benefit concert at
Greenfield where Kevin was the featured performer at the show, which
was trying to raise $17,000 for the high school's band trip to the
Cherry Blossom Festival in Washignton D.C.
</p>
<p>
He staged a benefit concert to raise money for Jimmy Kattau, a cancer
victim at Greenfield Junior High School, and customers at the Main
Street Music Store may request that a dollar from the sale of his album
go to the Greenfield band or to Michelle Gorman, a young Carthage girl
suffering from leukemia.
</p>
<p>
Kevin's goal for the future is a national record contract with national
distribution on a major level.  he has acquired a manager and is hoping
to make more personal appearances in the Indianapolis area, continue
writing songs, and waiting for that "lucky break".

The closure of this re-issue project comes nearly two years after its
inception.  Murphy's Law ran rampart at every turn.  I won't bore
you with details but after all is said and done this has
been a great learning experience and has produced a
product that is very dear to my heart and that I am proud
to put my name on.  (Speaking, of course, only on the
terms of re-issusing a work that obviously stands on its
own merit)
</p>
<p>
It's not that I feel I must justify why I was chosen to
handle this project, after several other efforts were
made in the last few years to do so, but I will anyway.
</p>
<p>
It was fate that led me to a Ramada Inn lounge on my 21st
birthday, on that cold November night in 1975.  That
night I was entertained by a band known as Jubal.  Jubal
was indeed Zerfas, who had just returned to their
original band name for commercial reasons.  (Note: Dave
and Herman Zerfas were the nucleus of Jubal (late '69 -
early '70 through early '73, which was then renamed the
band Zerfas (early '73 - mid-late '75) and back to Jubal,
A.K.A. The Jubal Band late '75 - early '83) Through a
quick and interesting chain of events, I joined the band
only one week later as percussionist (congas, bongos,
timbales, etc.) and additional vocals.  I remained in
that position until late April of 1981.
</p>
<p>
I immediately realized these guys were serious about what
they were doing and this was a lifestyle, not a sideline.
The band was blessed with access to a 40-acre farm with a
wonderful two story house and a two story barn,
headquarters for many years, thanks to the ever
supportive Mom and Pop Zerfas.  At most any given time,
many or all band members and road crew lived under the
same roof that included no less than seven bedrooms (a
couple were makeshift from the library and the workshop)
and a wonderful family room that became our rehearsal
hall when we were there.
</p>
<p>
When we were there indeed!  The band maintanined a
schedule that put us on the road no less than 40 weeks a
year, sometimes for a 13 week stretch at a time, covering
no less than an 18 state area throughout the duration.
</p>
<p>
The touring Jubal/Zerfas entourage of late '75 - early
'83,including Dave Zerfas at the helm, along with younger
brother Brian (Herman being a long-time nickname) and
Steve Newbold (who shared a bond as strong as brothers to
both) on bass, along with me and a parade of guitar
players, a couple of female members and even a short
stint with a fellow named Pat Smith, on second keyboards,
who was previously with a group called The Elders, who
put out an obscure LP on The Audio-Fidelity label called
&quot;Looking For The Answer&quot;.  Billy Rice, from the
Zerfas LP days, also traveled for a good while with the
band, in a different capacity however, as Road Manager,
Sound Engineer and all around jack-of-all-trades, as well
as close friend to us all.  Mark Tribby would drop by to
visit from time to time, but never took an active part in
the band after the Zerfas LP days of '73.
</p>
<p>
While we were scheduling time at 700 West for a club demo
to be done in January of '76, was the first time I was
introduced to the Zerfas Lp.
</p>
<p>
I saw a copy at the farm and inquired, "Hey, what's this
into?"  Very low key, Dave proceeded to tell me that was
a little something they had thrown together a couple of
years ago and asked would I like to hear it.  Well, the
grooves were full of magic and I was totally in awe.  I
listened to the LP several times in the next couple of
days and really got hooked on the material immediately.
I became a Zerfas prophet, turning my circle of friends
onto this newly discovered gem and was proud to be a part
of the band that included the nucleus of this album.  I
later found out that they had not "thrown this together"
at all, but instead saved every dime from side jobs and
every spare moment in the studio to make this dream of
theirs a reality.  The sincerity shines through on their
production, coming from the corn fields of rural Indiana
which had a relaxed, almost "3 or 4 years behind the
times" feel, if you will.  Not saying that was a bad
thing, it's just that these guys weren't driven by New
York or LA standards at the time.
</p>
<p>
When the time came to re-work some of the Zerfas LP tunes
to fit in with our nightclub song list, I was excited
about the possibilities.  Through the duration of the
band, we worked out and sometimes re-arranged several
times, such cuts a, "The Sweetest Part", "Stoney
Wellitz", and "The Piper", which were also updated and
documented in studio-demo sessions, along with several
more original tunes, as the band had three strong
songwriters in Dave, Herman and Steve.  I believe once we
even tackled the song "Hope" for s hort period (performed
live).
</p>
<p>
But I'm sort of getting ahead of myself.  Shortly after
my introduction to the Zerfas LP, I was also soon to
learn that there was a ton-o'-stuff "in the can" if you
will.  For instance, a 14 song, all original demo,
recorded in 1970, with the original band including Dave,
Herman, as well as friend Paul McBee and Karl Hinkle,
later of Wright Brothers Overland Stage Company, (later
known as The Wright Brothers, with a short stint on
Warner Brothers).  It includes the original recording of
"I Need It Higher" and 13 others that I hope to make
available in the future.  I also discovered several
home-made projects that I would discribe as
"mini-psychedelic rock operas", including musical as well
as spoken-word passages.  A couple that really struck me
were called "Rat Poop" and "My Friend John".  All of this
reconfirmed the fact that these guys were a bit left of
center, which made me feel right at home.  It was great
to be surrounded by their energy and creativity.  Also,
included in their back catalog was a piece that was the
first portion, Chapter Three, if you will, of the Zerfas
Saga.  Its name: "Winds Of Change", a long musical/vocal
piece that is a wonderful compliment to the Zerfas LP
itself.  It goes through several moods and changes and
climaxes with a piece now known as "Mr. Greenthumbs",
which we used as a staple of our live stage show.  A
killer combination of interweaving melodies and many
changes too hard to really put into words.  Hopefully,
you'll be hearing this and other never before released
works in the near future.
</p>
<p>
This finally brings us to the present.
</p>
<p>
Only after being approached by no less than three or four
gentlemen, who all has similar stories about hearing an
album over at a friend's house, late one evening while
sitting by the fireplace, did the resurgence begin.
</p>
<p>
They then told me they had heard from a friend of a
friend that I may have c copy of the album to sell them
and "oh, by the way, my brother was also there and he'd
like one too!"
That's when I would go into my 5 minute spiel about how
rare and valuable the record was, being a 500 copy press
from them 16 years ago and I would have to have what was
basically the price of a steak dinner for two for a copy.
I should have gotten a hint from the sparks that flew
from their wallets as they were pulling them from their
back pockets.  In all, seven original copies were sold
this way and all the gentlemen turned out to be record
dealers and I'm sure they are still eating steak dinners
here five years later after re-selling those copies.  You
live, you learn!
</p>
<p>
My curiosity had definitely been aroused, but only until
I met my now good friend and mentor, Stan Denski, did I
realize the new found popularity (not to mention the true
value) of the Zerfas album.  He planted the seed about
the possible re-issue of the album, which is finally a
reality.  He also jokingly nick-named me "Howard of the
Seven Copies".
</p>
<p>
The initial phone call to Dave Zerfas found him both
pleased and confused.  What?  Interest in the Zerfas LP
20 years later??? To be quite frank, we hadn't spoken to
each other in 10 years, as we parted ways when I left the
band in '81.  But it was as if we had never been apart.
Our mutual respect and trust for one another led to this
official 2nd press, if you will, of the Zerfas LP.
</p>
<p>
Dave indeed had possession of the original master tapes,
that is the source from which this re-issue was made.
Special thanks for making them available to me.
</p>
<p>
Moe Whittemore was kind enough to let us resurrect the 700
West label and also provide valuable studio information
from his personal archives for which we are ever so
grateful.
</p>
<p>
Brian (Herman) Zerfas provided song by song musician line
up and comments about each song with an occasional
interjection by Dave Zerfas.
</p>
<p>
Special thanks to Stan Denski for his overall view of the
genre and also for designing the poster to fit the feel
and mode of the album, as well as his help in many
aspects of this project.
</p>
<p>
The album was recorded using the anlog process every step
of the way and pressed on 180 gram dye-colored virgin
vinyl and packaged in high quality record jackets from
Villa Platte (one of the last batches of covers to leave
the factory before the fire).
</p>
<p>
The cover slicks were reproduced with strict attention to
detail.  Cover and back album art, as well as inner
record label, are exact in color and info as the orginal.
The only addition is the 1994 copyright, as well as a
slight reduction of front and back cover size.
</p>
<p>
Note: In the trail-off groove in both sides of the LP is
inscribed, "DELICATED TO THE MEMORY OF DENNY AND WALTER".
Personally, I would have chosen a high school graduate to
make these inscriptions, as they are supposed to read as
follows: "DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF DANNY AND WALTER".
<i>Delicated</i> is not a word and DANNY is spelled
D-A-N-N-Y, just like on the FAX I sent to the New York
pressing plant.  BUH!!
</p>
<p>
This mistake is corrected on the poster included in this
package.  Danny traveled with the band and was a true
brother to us all, especially to me.  Walter was a close
friend to us all and his impact and friendship will never
be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
Along with all the info and poster, included is the
official 8 X 10 promo photo of the band, sent out only
with a few promo copies of the original LP.
</p>
<p>
The album re-issue has been limited to a 500 copy
pressing to match the original release of 21 years ago.
Each is hand numbered and will not be re-pressed.  When
these are gone, they're gone, as they say.
</p>
<p>
In closing, once again special thanks to Dave and Brian
Zerfas and Steve Newbold, Moe Whittemore, producer,
engineer and owner of 700 West Studios, Stan Denski of
Impossible Records/OR Records and Rick Kingsley,
President of Sun Press.

Want some Zerfas trivia?  The following dated notes were
taken from the 700 West studio logbook and gig sheets.
The items with bullets are recent reflections, of
possible interest to buffs.
</p>
<p>
The Zerfas connection began when the studio solicited its
early business in part by sending letters to prospects on
the local union "leader list".  Throughout the Zerfas
album sessions, the studio was constantly undergoing
improvements; wall treatments, mic upgrades, monitor
speaker revisions, new signal processing equipment
constructed (and eagerly used by Dave, Herman &
Company), etc,.
</p>
<p>
Zerfas and 700 West.  We grew up together.
</p>
<p>
9/19/72 - Dave Zerfas ("Jubal") responds to direct mail ad to union musicians with studio visit.
Was sufficiently impressed to want studio time, soon.
<br/>
10/3/72 - Jubal visit.
<br/>
12/2/72 - Dave called to say group won't be ready til Jan. '73
<br/>
1/20/73 - Dave called to say they're ready to go on LP.
</p>
<p className='moe'>
The mics used early in the project reflected the shoestring nature
of this new business; AKG D190E dynamics, 700 West C7 condensors (handmade
double button cardiod mics), EV 1711 electret condenser omnis.
Unfortunately for Zerfas the Neumann U-47 was to come after this album project
was finished - but they did get about 2 months use of the Sony C37A condenser
mic purchased about midway thru the project.
For the Techno-Zerfs; the main recorder was a 3M four-tracker, Model 400; transfers
and submasters were handled by a highly modified Magnecorder PT6-H.  Most selections
utilized the "4-to-2-to-4" transfer method, when standard track bouncing on the 3M wasn't enough.
The mastering tape used for the project was Audiotape 2506 (similar to Ampex
456 "Grand Master", but 2 years ahead of it) and after 20 years of storage the
back coating on the submasters is beginning to shed - not too many plays left in the old stuff!
The console was a modular, totally patchable, homebuilt 4x2 with shelving eq, with
integrated Teletronics LA-3A compressors.  (20 years later, it's in constant use
by my son and his group!)  The
reverb devices were homebuilt stretched plates similar to the EMT units.  The backwards
reverb effect on "Stoney Willitz" is representative of what they could do.

</p>
<p className='moe'>
Following the success of the album Zerfas (Jubal) hit the road.  The group made a
living as a successful touring band, especially appreciated by their fans in the
Southeast U.S.  The studio would work with them on four more projects, the
last being July 1981.  700 West closed its doors in december 1983, as did
Jubal earlier that same year, leaving behind some very high priced collectibe
records - and some great memories!
</p>
<p>
Other Zerfas/Jubal projects at 700 West:
</p>
<p className='moe'>
In January 1976, Zerfas returned to cut a 5 tune club demo of
then-current hits; "Somebody To Love", "Schoolboy Crush",
"Nights On Braodway", "Fame" and "Desperado".  During this
preiod, Nancy Dorsey was added as vocalist.  The project required
22 "money" (studio) hours over a 3 day period.  (It was 700 West's
next-to-last 4 track session.  Our new 8 track machine was to arrive
shortly after Zerfas was back on the road!)  The half-track submaster of this
session still exists, much to Dave's chagrin!
</p>
<p className='moe'>
A year later (February 1977) finds Jubal/Zerfas with new material
which would become the foundation of their "Winds Of Change" project -
to be shown to major record labels.  The female vocalist was no longer
part of the group.  Due to arrangements with an Atlanta studio the rhythm tracks
and groove would be set at 700 West, then vocals and mixes would
be done there.
</p>
<p className='moe'>
700 West was now an 8-track studio, with 4-track backup.
To accomodate the traditionally dense Jubal arrangements,
track bouncing, transfers (8-to-4) and sync tapes using 2 machines (4-to-8) were
the order of the day.  With care and advance planning, these tricks
yielded 24 track performance.  The sync tape method was extended to include lead
and backup vocals, as well as certain guitar and keyboard tracks.  An added bonus of
this technique is that one could make the vocals (or backing instruments) lead
or lag the rhythm tracks, giving a composition either a hot or laid-back feel -
after the fact!
</p>
<p className='moe'>
Beds for three tunes were laid; "Mr. Green Thumbs", "Sweetest Part" and "Stoney Wellitz" -
the last two being an update of the original album cuts.  By now, the group's
instrumentation was changing too, with Mini-Moog and Orchestron keyboards becoming
part of the arsenal.  This session required 32 studio hours spread over 3 weeks.
All tapes were subsequently lost when the Atlanta studio mysteriously caught fire
during the time the band was recording there!
</p>
<p className='moe'>
Jubal dropped by again in early November 1978 for a "quick mix" of 2 tunes and
copy some previously recorded material.
</p>
<p className='moe'>
They came back in late November, working until February on an all-original
record company demo, redoing and updating the material lost in the Atlanta fire.
the 100 studio hours spent on the Superdemo nearly equalled the time
spent on the original "Zerfas" album project!

Record collecting, in one form or another, has probably
been going on since the first fellow lost sleep over a
missing Edison cylinder in his collection.  If you wanted
to trace a history of <u>rare</u> record collecting (the
quest for the &quot;holy grail&quot; -- the intoxicating
aura of authenticity surrounding the &quot;impossible
object&quot;) it would likely lead you from the earliest
Blues 78s, past seriously rare Rockabilly and C&W
sides, down a hallway lined with ethereal and beautiful
doo-wop 45s, into a library of gloriously snotty
psychedelic garage-punk singles, and into a room full of
psychedelic oddities so large you can't tell where it
ends.
</p>
<p>
Sometime in the late-70s, maybe just into the early
1980s, a collector's scene began to take shape around the
loosely-defined category of &quot;private-label&quot;
LPs.  From the mid-60s on, the impact of records like
&quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;, &quot;Disraeli
Gears&quot;, &quot;Axis: Bold As Love&quot;,
&quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;Freak Out&quot;, &quot;Blonde
On Blonde&quot;, and others upon art and culture is
immeasurable.  One pretty direct effect of the trend was
that tens of thousands of us (maybe more) took to our
basements and garages with drums and guitars, cheap mics
run through tiny PA systems and made our own music.  Of
the five hundred people who will eventually hold a copy
of this record, I'd wager half or better once made way
too much noise in somebody's basement.

We played rough cover versions of &quot;I'm So
Glad&quot;, &quot;Good Lovin'&quot;, &quot;Hey Joe&quot;,
and countless others.  Most of us got over it after a
while; but many of us didn't.  Thousands of bands wrote
original songs, influenced by the incredible records that
filled the bins at the local stores.  Many of these
bands scraped together money from their day jobs and the
gigs they'd play at local clubs and auditoriums, borrowed
some money from families and friends and went into local
semi-pro recording studios (or set up borrowed
reel-to-reel recorders in makeshift basement studios) and
recorded some combination of covers and original
material.  Just like a very stoned John Lennon playing
the tape of &quot;Rain&quot; backwards, they made
mistakes and incorporated their accidents into music in
their own giddy stoned reverie.  Some would go so far as
to ship these tapes off to the nearest pressing plant
with payment for the minimum number of copies you could
have pressed, as few as 100, as many as 1,000.  Some paid
for generic covers of sunsets or clouds over the ocean,
covers they would unknowingly share with local gospel
quartet and high school marching band records - and some
would paste up their own covers over blank covers they
bought.  The records were sold at gigs and local head
shops, given away to friends and local radio stations,
the last box or two stashed away in an attic (still
waiting for somebody like me to find).
</p>
<p>
Now decades later, in a dollar bin, flea market, yard
sale or a local junk shop, somebody pulls out an
abandoned copy, dusty and scratched, the cover worn and
ripped from old glue and water damage, and takes it home,
cleans it up a bit, and drops the tone arm on the first
track.  Most of the time it's badly recorded, badly
played cocktail lounge music at best.  But every once in
a while, honest-to-God <u>magic</u> comes rushing out of
the speakers.  What the earliest private-press collectors
realized was that hidden in some of these records was
inspired song writing, arrangements, and playing as good
as anything the major labels had to offer.  These
collectors also took extra pleasure in the knowledge that
they were the first to hear these songs in this new
context.  And in this manner (or one very much like it)
the collector/dealer as psychedelic archaeologist was
born.
</p>
<p>
In truth, the bulk of what has emerged as the U.S.
private-press collector scene is comprised of records
that never has the polish and production values necessary
for the wider commercial appeal of the major label LPs.
A good portion of the education process - and a good
chunk of the pleasure therein - is in the acquisition of
<u>new ears</u> and <u>new eyes</u>; the expanded senses
necessary to find the treasures amid the trash in the
thrift store racks, and to find the magic in the dusty
grooves.
</p>
<p>
A record collector for the most of my life, I have spent
some time in recent years undergoing this process of
education/transformation - a gradual process of seduction
I have found a source of great personal enjoyment.  The
title I've put at the front of this short essay is the
title of scene 4 in avant-garde composer, Harry Partch's
1957 composition, &quot;The Bewitched&quot;.  I am taken with
the way the phrase &quot;a humanizing alchemy&quot; describes
with strinking accuracy those records we are all now
frantically searching for.  For me, this notion of a
&quot;humanizing alchemy&quot; has something to say about
the emotional sincerity, a kind of emotional
authenticity, the best of these records contain.  The
best of these records were made by people who beleived
that music was capable of saying BIG things - capabale of
expressing BIG answers to BIG questions.  Caught up in
this then, is a struggle for articulation as these
musicians, often very young and semi-professional
struggled to connect the notes in ways that would shed
light on, well, the meaning of life, the universe...
everything.
</p>
<p>
In many ways, <u>Zerfas</u> is the epitome of the U.S.
private-press psychedelic record.  A group of 18 and 19
year-olds, heads alive and bursting with all the
mythologies of the 1960s filtered through the vast flat
strangeness of the American midwest and their own unique
and rich creativity, finally raise the money to enter
Moe Whittemore's small recording studio in January of 1973.
In the six months that followed, led by David's fertile
imagination, they would use every device, every
recording trick and technique, every late-night accident
and mistake, to finally realize their vision and deliver
the closest thing Indiana would ever have to the
archetype of studio psychedelic LPs, &quot;Sergeant
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.
</p>
<p>
This record presents the first two chapters of what might
still yet be a work-in-progress (Dave had the first four
or five chapters worked out, and if he finishes these
sometime in the first decade of the new century he can
still claim to have out-paced George Lucas).  Starting
sometime in the early 1980s, <u>Zerfas</u> made its
earliest appearances on psych collector want lists -
usually in the form of &quot;Zerfus ?&quot; or "Zerphus
?&quot;, more rumor than record.  For a local record from
central Indiana, the original 500 copies seem to have
been spread by the four winds: copies have been found in
a New York radio station record library, a Colorado
thrift store, Marin County flea market - my own favorite
is a copy, now in a Minnesota collection, marked with the
stamp of the library of a state mental institution!
</p>
<p>
I first heard Zerfas some years back when a friend found
a copy at a local thrift store.  As the prelude to the
first track slowly faded up - a wondrously thick mix of
layered backwards and forward voices and sounds - I
remember thinking that this might just be the best thing
I'd ever heard.  the greatest strength of Zerfas is in
its rich mix of different techniques and approaches; and
ability to work across a wide range of styles - from the
opening garage sneer of &quot;You Never Win&quot; through
the dreamy psychedelia of &quot;The Piper&quot; - without
ever sacrificing an overall thematic and harmonic
continuity.  Across the two sides you can get some sense
of these musicians/artists laboring for hours in the
small studio to get just the right blend of harmony,
guitar, drums and organ to reach for that fleeting
glimpse of something larger than we are.  This is a great
LP that rewards repeated listening with new insights.
Enjoy.

Picture some extremely talented teenagers, still young enough to think that nothing in this world can
matter more than rock and roll, but mature enough to understand exactly what makes good music
and what doesn't. Now imagine that these teenagers win the lottery and decide to use their windfall
to spend an entire year in the recording studio. They write until they have eight songs they know are
great, then spend that year perfecting them, using every ounce of their imagination so that each
song reaches its absolute maximum potential. Luckily, they have a studio engineer who's as
creative as them, and while they go out of their way to experiment like crazy, everyone involved
has enough taste to use only the very best ideas.
</p>
<p>
Once you've let that concept sink in, clear your mind and try to imagine what might have happened
if the Beatles hadn't stepped away from psychedelia after 1967, and through some magic time warp
they went straight to 1973 with their inspiration and songwriting skills still at their peak. And when
they chose the songs for the 1973 album, someone smartly convinced McCartney to save his
crappy ballad for a B-side. Sound too good to be true? It's not. This album is every bit as good as
both of these scenarios. All of the studio effort wouldn't mean much if the songwriting isn't first rate,
but it is. It's at the level of, say, Anonymous' INSIDE THE SHADOW (oddly enough, also from
Indiana), or the Zombies' ODESSEY AND ORACLE. And while the band isn't composed of
virtuoso instrumentalists, neither are the Beatles or the Stones. The members of Zerfas play well
enough to express their ideas fully, have a solid sense of rhythm and timing, and every guitar solo,
keyboard interlude and drum roll are perfect. They're not complicated or show-offy, just perfect.
The lead guitar throughout also has an absolutely ideal sound, not too far removed from that on
ABBEY ROAD. It sounds like a Gretsch through a Leslie speaker; whether it is or not, it's just right
for these songs.
</p>
<p>
The Beatles' comparison, while justified, simplifies Zerfas and their sound. One can find bits of Pink
Floyd (from both prog and psych eras) here and there, ideas drawn from any major psychedelic
band you can imagine, and even a tiny nod towards punk rock (which they must have invented
because the Ramones' first concert was still more than a year away) on the opening 'You Never
Win'. The sound is a rich mix of keyboards and guitars, heavy only on 'You Never Win' and the
joyous boogie tune 'Stoney Wellitz,' but never wimpy. The vocals, other than the rough sing-speak
on 'You Never Win,' are smooth and poignant; the harmonies soar. The production is dense but not
cluttered, just dark enough for the effects to have power, but clear enough for the vocals to shine
through.
</p>
<p>
The structure of the album is impeccable. From the opening moment, it's obvious you're in for
something truly special. 'You Never Win' fades in with a backwards loop, over which a lovely
melody appears. It goes on for a while, but could continue for hours more without becoming
tiresome. It's as great and true a musical moment as there has ever been. Rudely, the drums disrupt
the calm to begin the body of the song, an updated 60s garage punker with powerful organ. As the
song nears the end, the opening melody recurs, only this time it's played forwards. It's at this
moment that you realize that this album is a true work of art, not just a bunch of great moments but a
perfectly conceived synthesis of ideas. If only to prove the point, within a few seconds of the next
song, 'The Sweetest Part,' we are treated to the most beautiful fuzz guitar riff in history. As the
album moves along, all of the eight songs have moments that, while unlikely to match the perfection
of the backwards bit or the searing fuzz riff, should send shivers down the most jaded spine.
</p>
<p>
The songs are enlivened by psychedelic experiments that range from the slowed-down laughter of
a tickled child to someone belching the words 'mushroom soup.' Not just each song, but each verse
is arranged with intricate care, and surprises like the stunning percussion that ends the quiet 'I Need
It Higher' keep the listener guessing. The two songs that begin side two show a bit of the spirit of
1973. The bouncy 'Stoney Wellitz' (and its almost trendy moog solo), and 'Hope', with its ocean
sound effects and long, layered keyboard solo, are longer and more likely to appeal to, say, prog
fans, than the pop-oriented songs on side one. That's not to say the seem out of place or don't work,
because they do, in spades. And in no time at all, we're back to massive walls of 60s-inspired
psychedelia. The introduction to 'Fool's Parade' is interrupted by a stunning backwards vocal (don't
listen to people who claim it says something; it's gibberish in both directions.) The body of the song
ends after only two minutes, only to be followed by two further minutes of sped-up guitar,
slowed-down guitar, space sounds and the aforementioned 'mushroom soup' reference.
</p>
<p>
This is all set-up, though, for the album's finest moment, the closing 'The Piper.' A more ideal pop
song is unlikely to exist. From the opening piano trills to gorgeous verses to gorgeous bridge to
gorgeous chorus to stunning keyboard solo to the most perfect of the album's many perfect guitar
solos, in just four minutes they've done the impossible. They top what came before. The album ends
on the final moment of genius; the piano trill returns and then is abruptly cut off, leaving the listener
with his or her mouth hanging wide open. Not only has the song itself been framed by the piano, so
has the album as a whole; the first and last song share the framing device, and the abrupt end is as
compelling as the backwards fade-in.
</p>
<p>
No, this album isn't completely perfect. I'm not entirely convinced that the speak-singing on 'You
Never Win' really works, and perhaps the plethora of clever arrangement ideas push both 'Stoney
Wellitz' and 'You Don't Understand' a verse too long. Oh, and this will never be my own personal
favorite album because the lyrics don't hit home with me in the way something has to in order to be
a #1 desert island pick. But musically, there's no album on this universe I enjoy more than ZERFAS,
and no album from which I can discover more new joys after hundreds of listens. The first reissue
of this album contains several pages of notes about the band, and presumably gives some idea why
they never released any more music. I've never found this issue of the record; I'm not sure I even
want to know the answer to the many questions I have about these guys. And, oddly, the fact that it
was never followed is almost a plus, a way of making sure that this album's greatness will never be
tarnished by the company it keeps. Obviously my view on this album is full of bias; only a few people
will love it quite as much as I do. But most will love it almost as much.
</p>
<p>
This is one of those rare albums that justifies its huge price tag. It's also proof that an independently
produced album can have the perfect combination no mainstream album ever had after the mid 60s:
it's free of any commercial pressures, but was made with the kind of studio time and energy
normally allotted to major label releases. There are more great ideas here than in the whole history
of (to pick a band who used more studio time than anyone else) Queen, and more inspired
freakiness than in the entire catalogue of 60s San Francisco bands. Psych fans and classic rock fans
alike can appreciate it. In all seriousness, collectors spend their whole lives looking for just one
album that justifies their quest. I've found mine.

Indianapolis rock maven’s attempt of a closet stardom that secured him a cult glory.
</p>
<p>
It was a matter of perseverance rather than trying to seize the concepts listed on this album’s sleeve. With only 300 copies pressed, same quantity as 1978’s “Into You” by McKAY - an earlier vehicle for Ray Pierle’s creations - the artist’s first solo LP didn’t make much of a splash either, yet what ripple it sent down the line turned the record into an obscure classic. The key to the album’s success is its songs’ immediacy, some of those being demos, and their hard rock sharpness, which brings the aforementioned concepts into focus, although the brilliance of Ray’s twin-guitar weave on the title track is defying tentative cheapness or hurriedness of Pierle’s approach.
</p>
<p>
This piece has much more glam in its fuzz than a deliberately rough cut of rollicking jive that is “Roll Me Up” or “Workingman’s Blue” whose middle-of-the-road harmonies and crunch lift the heavy lid of the number’s subject, but then the twang of “C’mon Strange Dance” is bent into elegant funk. Groove’s the king here, as the six-string strains in “Till The End Of The Night” provide ample space for a cosmic country-rock roll, one so light in “Just Thinking.” Elsewhere, the riffs of “Start Over” welcome progressive patterns into the mix, before the “Wish I’d Always Feel This Way” blues are dipped in psych bleach, yet “Madman Money” stages a return to the record’s underlying theme - common laborer vs big buck - rather playfully wrapping the bitter truth into the catchiest of tunes.
</p>
<p>
It’s a desperate LP in many aspects, and one of them had been its desire to be widely heard. Now, this wish is granted.

Front porch guitar playing and singing in church was the extent of my musical
efforts until I met Stan.  Continual prodding on his part convinced me that just
maybe we could make something of our talents.  His love for music coupled
with good guitar playing is expressed throughout the album.
</p>
<p>
One definition in the dictionary for the word crzay is "very ethusiastic or eager."
When it comes to recording something on tape, Moe is just that.  His eagerness
to create good sound plus a degree in electrical engineering has made him
perfect for his job.  With all due respect, Moe is crazy.
</p>
<p>
The musicians that helped me with this album deserve more than my thanks.
They deserve your listening.  I know you will appreciate them as much as I do.
Producing an album requires more than just money, it requires a belief in the investment.
</p>
<p>
Thank you... Bill for being a believer.

For those who enjoy checking out Indiana's musical history, 'The Best of
700 West Vol. 1' is probably this year's essential purchase. This
compilation comes from the archives of 700 West Recording which was a
small recording studio in New Palestine, IN that operated from 1971 to
1983. Studio owner Mo Whittemore assembled this compilation
highlighting, in his opinion, the best of the many musicians who recorded
at 700 West over the years.
</p>
<p>
Because the collection is a comprehensive cross-section of acts that
recorded at 700 West running the gamut from gospel to experimental
electronic music, it's easy to say that there is probably something for
everybody here. It's also fairly safe to say that not everything on this disc
is going to appeal to all listeners. Still, in addition to gems like the funky
Ultimate Force and the proto-metal sludge of Primevil, the main thing
that struck me about this compilation was the high quality throughout all
the tracks. Though I can't say all the artists here appeal to me personally,
the highlights are fantastic and as a whole, 'The Best of 700 West Vol. 1'
once again shows the depth and excellence that Indiana's musical past has
to offer.

Long relegated to various rarity compilations, Indianapolis eight-piece Amnesty (meaning
second chance) have finally been recognised in a collection of recordings kept by long-time
band archivist, bassist, and keeper-of-the-faith James Red Massie. The result is a melting pot
of early 70s psychedelic funk, jazz, rock and vocal harmonies. A strange combination, it
attempts to catalogue the groups evolution as they seek satisfaction in their second stab at
fame.
</p>
<p>
Although they originally released only one 7-inch for the Lamp label (home of other
psychedelic funk acts such as the Ebony Rhythm Band and The Diplomatics), Amnesty found a home
at Moe Whittemores 700 West Studio in 1973. Here, along with that fateful 7-inch, they taped
five hard funk numbers and a string of ballads and demos. From these sessions, they released
<b>Three Cheers for Baby </b>and <b>Lord Help Me</b> as the B-side. The former song
showcases their vocal abilities and their love for Temptations-inspired harmonies. Similar to
other tracks on this compilation such as <b>We've Come A Long Way</b>, the backing of these
vocal tracks is incredibly gritty and real. Amnesty's sophisticated sweep and flow of horns,
wah-wah, and percussion produces an amazing intensity; one which transcends the boundaries of
pop.
</p>
<p>
On the released B-side, <b>Lord Help Me</b> dishes out a hot serving of
supergroovalistic-parliament-thang. While the brass arrangement doesnt sit with the likes of
Fred Wesley, the call/response idiom familiar to gospel and the scathing
proto-political/economic musings (the price of meat/almost higher than dope in the streets)
are a fine slice of funk. This particular track sheds real light on the groups potential.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the opener <b>Can I Help You?</b> and <b>Mister President</b> seem to
combine the rhythms of Cymande with the psychedelic contemplations of Indianapolis
brothers-in-arms Ebony Rhythm Band - a combination which seems to flavour many of the featured
recordings. <b>Love Fades</b> is also steeped in funkadelic flavours that wouldnt be out of
place on Cosmic Slop.
</p>
<p>
Not only does <b>Free Your Mind</b> showcase the talent of a greatly overlooked funk act,
it is also a damn fine record for your average funk listener.
</p>

Mary grab the baby, river’s rising
Muddy water’s taking back the land
Well this old house, it won’t take one more beating
Ain’t no use to stay and make a stand

The morning light showed water in the valley
Daddy’s grave just went below the line
Things to save, you just can’t take them with you
The flood will swallow all we leave behind

I won’t be back to start all over
Cause what I felt before is gone
Mary grab the baby, river’s rising
Muddy water’s taking back our home

Now the road is gone, there’s just one way to leave here
I’ll turn my back on what I’ve left below
Shifting land and broken farms around me
Muddy water’s changing all I know

It’s hard to say just what I’m losing
Ain’t never been so all alone
Mary grab the baby, river’s rising
Muddy water’s taking back my home
Well, muddy water’s taking back my home

w me, I work at Harold's Super Service
We specialize in service all the way
And there's only one thing that really bugs me
This big ole boy in his stripped-down Model A

At Harold's Super Service, we do grease jobs
We fix fifty, sixty flats every day
And just about the time we get real busy
Here comes this boy in his stripped-down Model A

He says, "Gimme 50 cents worth of regular
Check, my oil too, if you don't mind
Put some air in my tires, won't you mister?
Wash my windows too, if you have time"

Last night I dreamed I died and went to Heaven
To that big ole Super Service in the sky
I was satisfied a-pumping gas forever
For the Angels in the sweet by and by

Now the Pearly Gates was just around the corner
I could see the new ones comin' every day
I was changin' plugs on Moses' Magic Carpet
When up thru the clouds there came this Model A

He says, "Gimme 50 cents worth of regular
Check, my oil too, if you don't mind
Put some air in my tires, won't you mister?
Wash my windows too, if you have time"

Faithful hearts are my tools

To all my friends, and with a grin
But now, at last, I realize
I said your heart I'd surely win
But now I'm alone with my lies

Her laughing eyes, her loving smile
Oh God, bring back those joyful times
To hold her close for a little while
Bring back those days when she was mine

Upon whose heart can I rely
When days are long and nights are cold?
Who gives to me a loving smile?
Whose loving hands have I to hold?

My plans and schemes were not so wise
The broken heart I thought I'd see
To rid my soul of tears you shed
Too late, I find belongs to me

Her laughing eyes, her loving smile
Oh God, bring back those joyful times
To hold her close for a little while
Bring back those days when she was mine

Lonesome for those Pineywoods

I was born in the Georgia Pineywoods
Fifteen miles to the grocery store
No T.V. or gold-plated shiny goods
Cracked old linoleum on the floor

Well, we had cows in the back fields grazing
Chickens a-crowing out in the pen
Life was good but it's amazing
How I couldn't see that back then

Miss those Georgia Pineywoods
Wonder if they miss me
Lonesome for those Pineywoods
Ancient home of the Cree, and the Cherokee, and me

Well, when I looked for Indian arrowheads
I was happy as Borden's cow
I've lost all my Indian arrowheads
Ain't no good to me here no how

Well, I get paid now by the hour
And lead my typical suburb life
Got credit cards and buying power
And I owe more money than Caesar's wife

Miss those Georgia Pineywoods
Wonder if they miss me
Lonesome for those Pineywoods
Ancient home of the Cree, and the Cherokee, and me

Twas on a rainy day
To rise above the throng
And talk with Mother Nature for a while

She told me of her love
For the children in her trust
And of her grave concern
For the likes of you and me and us

Crying though she was
She did speak these tender words
"Things that I am
I can not change for any man"

I tried to comfort her
But she would not be still
And as the rains did fall
I found my way back down the Redwood Hills

Crying though she was
She did speak these tender words
"Things that I am
I can not change for any man"

I tried to comfort her
But she would not be still
I'll not forget the day
When Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hills
I'll not forget the day

No longer can charm my soul
For pleasures, I find in peace and in mind
Since Jesus has made me whole

Come out of the night, come into the light
Where souls are supremely blessed

I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
I wish I was in Dixie, away

In Dixie land, I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away, away, away, away
Down south in Dixie

I’m dreaming tonight of Dixie
That’s where I love to roam
The roosters crow at the break of day
In my Dixie home sweet home

Oh people here, they just don’t care
I never saw the beat
That road ahead is mighty long
But it’s Dixieland for me

I was going back to my old home
In the mountains far away
The wild red roses smell so sweet
And the rippling waters play

Oh people here, they just don’t care
I never saw the beat
That road ahead is mighty long
But it’s Dixieland for me

Yes, city life is not for me
I'm going where the neighbors speak
That road ahead is mighty long
But it’s Dixieland for me

Oh people here they just don’t care
I never saw the beat
That road ahead is mighty long
But it’s Dixieland for me

Away, away, away, away
Down south in Dixie

				lyrics: `
Well, I'm so lonesome, I could cry
And you know the reason why
It's because you went away and left me

It's been two long years or more
Since you walked out the door
And time just doesn't seem to change things

Well, I've tried everything I know
But I just can't control
These feelings that burn deep inside me

If I had one more chance again
And if we could be best friends
Then time would be so everlasting

And we could both be together once again
And forget about those things way back then
And we would be like a feather in the wind
And time would be our best friend

Now I've waited oh so long
For you to come back home
Please untie these chains that surround me

It's been such a long, long time
And I'm bout to lose my mind
Your love is my key to happiness

So I'm begging you right now
Please come home, I'll make a vow
My love will be never-ending

Oh yes, I promise to be true
Give my life and love to you
And I'll always do the things you want me to

And we could both be together once again
And forget about those things way back then
And we would be like a feather in the wind
And time would be our best friend

The preacher talked with me and he smiled
Said "Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile
For once in your life, you're alone
And you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone"

I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

I told him I'm in no hurry
And if I broke her heart, won't you tell her I'm sorry
For once in my life, I'm alone
And I have to let her know just in time before I go

I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

I lied, but that didn't work
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this hurt
I lied, but deep down inside
Well I did it to him, now it's my turn to die

I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

And the walls came tumbling down

If you will trust in the power of the blood
And you hope to wear a crown
Go forward quickly and obey the holy word
All your doubts will tumble down

And the walls came tumbling down
Joshua marched seven times around
And the walls came tumbling down

				sometime during the depression and wrote the song down after a night of drinking with Shanty and some other guys.
				A year or so later it was on the radio and was a hit.  Unfortunately Shanty never got credit or dime for writing

1978 recordings for WFBQ Homegrown Album submission
</p>

<p>
Songs:
Band of the Year,
Drummer Star,
Stranger,
Blue and Burned Out,
				</p>

<p>
Local band from Greenfield looking to make some recordings to submit to the WFBQ radio contest. Winners would have their song included on the album entitled Homegrown. We did not win but we received airplay and the band name appeared on the record sleeve.
				</p>

<p>
Everyone in Greenfiled knew of 700 West. This was, afterall, where Primevil had recorded. We knew those guys well. Most of our equipment had come from Main Street Music. Rick was and still is a friend of Jay Wilfong. Plus he knew some of the other members of Primevil and still keep in touch with them today through social media.
				</p>

<p>
So the band made an appointment and drove out to that special farmhouse. Set up the equipment, did a sound check, took Moe's advice and reset some amp settings and did another sound check.
We recorded all four songs, taking a Dairy Queen break about halfway through. Listened to the rough mix, laughing at Moe's lyric changes on Stranger from "oh what a  strange one" to "oh what a long one". Vocal tracks had been double tracked but had to drop that on the end of Stranger. The evil laugh Dan had done sounded slightly 'mental hospital' when doubled.
				</p>

<p>
Mike and John went back for the master mix in the next day or so. They came back with some cassettes to send off to the radio station. That was the only copies we had except Mike kept a copy himself. It would be 20+ years later before Rick was able to track him down and get copies for himself and Dan.
				</p>

				<p>
It was an experience not to be forgotten. Our first visit to a real studio. This event impacted at least two of the band members. John has his own home studio now. Rick still plays and does recording work at his cousin's home studio. Plus he has his own home studio for mastering their covers and originals.

						You had to know just where to turn
						It was a little county road with a driveway that wound thru a cornfield
						Out at 700 West, he gave the bands a chance and they gave it their best---
						and it sure showed.......
						
						If you get the chance to take it
						Ride the county road, someone's gonna make it
						
						Some played metal, some played steel
						They played it from the heart and he caught it on reel---on an 8 track
						I'd like to tell you if I could about the ones you never heard
						They sure sounded good on that old farm
						
						So If you get the chance to take it....
						
						On summer nights, if the song was right
						You'd feel there's nothing you can't do
						When the light turned red, the lyrics in your head
						You'd feel the magic inside you
						
						Now collectors stand in line, bidding up the price on the records they're
						buying---
						from the old days.......
						The bidding's up, the bidding's down, but the only thing that matters
						Is the way that it sounds in the long run........
						
						So if you get the chance.........
						
						On summer nights.........
						
						Even though the odds were long, everybody wonders how far they'd have gone
						with some airplay
						But I'd like to tell you if I could about the ones you never heard....
						They sure sounded good on that old farm..........
