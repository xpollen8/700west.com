			Amnesty was a legendary Indianapolis funk band, known for their hard-hitting grooves and soaring vocal harmonies. The music Amnesty recorded at 700 West has been streamed millions of times online and sampled in hip-hop tracks by Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, and Ye - the artist formerly known as Kanye West.
			<p />
			 In 1973, Amnesty traveled to New Palestine, Indiana – a small town east of Indianapolis. Their destination was 700 West, a modest recording studio located in the home of Moe Whittemore. 
			<p />
			 Amnesty recorded 10 tracks at 700 West. Two of those recordings were issued on Whittemore’s 700 West label – but the full sessions remained unreleased for over 30 years. In 2007 the California-based label Now Again issued the complete Amnesty 700 West sessions. The album was titled “Free Your Mind” and it became an instant classic among funk and soul music fans.
