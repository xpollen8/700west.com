As I recall, Jay Wilfong was the person who first introduced me
to Moe and 700 West. I was immediately impressed
with the audio quality and I think the first cut I heard
out there was Ezekial Longspur's song about
"Rolling Down the Highway."  It sounded so good that
it was obvious this Whittemore guy knew what he was
doing...........
</p>
<p>
Shortly after that I played bass on a demo for
Bill Jackson and Tom Mobley at 700 West. Rex Thomas also
sat in on that one on steel. Jackson was a superb
vocalist, and I still think he was one of the best
I've ever been around........... Tom later got
involved with Sequoia, but I don't know what
happened to Bill.......... He sang one song called
"The Death of the Circus with No Thanks to
Fellini" that I wish I could hear again............
Definitely good stuff............
</p>
<p>
I remember sitting on that little padded bench
Moe had by the window in the control room and
watching him work wonders. He was always
lighting up a fresh batch of tobacco in his pipe, and
his favorite past-time was making up humorous new lyrics for
our songs. We learned so much from him about mike placement
and ping-pong techniques for recording with limited tracks.
</p>
<p>
We were really blessed to have so much talent in that place.
The people who sat in on our album project were really
good. Obviously, Jerry De Rome and Jay Wilfong were
a tremendous help. Jim Moore, who was the steel
guitarist for Bill Wilson, did a great job. We couldn't
afford to pay the session players, but they just did it
because they wanted to record out there. Everybody did.
</p>
<p>
I remember I later tried to return the favor by playing
bass for some other artists there. I don't recall all of the
projects, but I do remember playing  on a single
or two for Ed Ott.
</p>
<p>
Moe invested a tremendous amount of time and patience in all
of us. He could fix so many problems. I had a strap button let
go  and my priceless Gibson J-50 fell on concrete one
night. You could have dropped a golf ball through the back of
it. Moe repaired it, and I ended up using it on the acoustic
lead break in "I've Seen Your Face."  I still use that old Gibson
for recording...............
</p>
<p>
700 West was such a unique place to record. You could hear
goats outside and smell Moe's coffee brewing inside. He had
a knack for putting you at ease with his sense of humor, and
that was really important---- especially the first few times
you saw that red recording light go on..........

<div className="lyrics">
You had to know just where to turn<br/>
It was a little county road with a driveway that wound thru a cornfield<br/>
Out at 700 West, he gave the bands a chance and they gave it their best---<br/>
and it sure showed.......<br/>
<br/>
If you get the chance to take it<br/>
Ride the county road, someone's gonna make it<br/>
<br/>
Some played metal, some played steel<br/>
They played it from the heart and he caught it on reel---on an 8 track<br/>
I'd like to tell you if I could about the ones you never heard<br/>
They sure sounded good on that old farm<br/>
<br/>
So If you get the chance to take it....<br/>
<br/>
On summer nights, if the song was right<br/>
You'd feel there's nothing you can't do<br/>
When the light turned red, the lyrics in your head<br/>
You'd feel the magic inside you<br/>
<br/>
Now collectors stand in line, bidding up the price on the records they're<br/>
buying---<br/>
from the old days.......<br/>
The bidding's up, the bidding's down, but the only thing that matters<br/>
Is the way that it sounds in the long run........<br/>
<br/>
So if you get the chance.........<br/>
<br/>
On summer nights.........<br/>
<br/>
Even though the odds were long, everybody wonders how far they'd have gone<br/>
with some airplay<br/>
But I'd like to tell you if I could about the ones you never heard....<br/>
They sure sounded good on that old farm..........<br/>

			In 1976, at the age of 23, I released my fist solo album, 'To Make The Night Complete' on my own label, JMH Records. In addition to writing and arranging all of the material, I also played all of the instruments except drums and produced the entire project myself. I then promoted extensive radio air-play and marketed the record throughout the mid west resulting in sales of substantial proportions and enjoyed two #1 regional hit singles, You're But A Dream, My Lady and My Music.
