			Day Before Tomorrow (1978), Stonerock’s debut recording, was released to positive reviews under the popular cult label 700 West. In the 1980s, he turned his attention to writing and acting, developing several one-man, history-based shows of which he has performed over 4,000 times—and counting.

			In 1976, at the age of 23, I released my fist solo album, 'To Make The Night Complete' on my own label, JMH Records. In addition to writing and arranging all of the material, I also played all of the instruments except drums and produced the entire project myself. I then promoted extensive radio air-play and marketed the record throughout the mid west resulting in sales of substantial proportions and enjoyed two #1 regional hit singles, You're But A Dream, My Lady and My Music.
