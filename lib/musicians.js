			When I made the decision to leave the band, and give up on the dream ? .... it was because I just couldn't see that 'being a Rock Star'  was ever gonna happen?  and My Dad, and 'Life Hero' was telling me to " Cut Yer Hair and BE somebody!!! " .... But it was like going 'Cold Turkey' off Crack Cocaine ? ... I floundered with my Identity .... I had Ate,Slept,and Drank 'The Band' for seven years, and I didn't know what to do with myself? ... I bought a building lot, and intended to build a house on it, but Indiana Government buried me with so much Red Tape, that I ended up selling the lot for less than I paid for it?  .... about that time .... My Parents bought a farm in Tennessee ? ... I helped them load a Ryder Truck and followed them down there to unload it.         I was Awestruck at the Beauty of the countryside in Tennessee .... TREES and Valleys, that just took my breath away? .... My Dad said it was like Indiana was, 20 years earlier ? ... I decided to move to Tennessee too !!! .... When I left Indiana, they had not one? ... but TWO, single engine airplanes ... flying over the County, to spot some poor guy, fixing his roof shingles without a Permit !!! .... When I moved to Tennessee, I asked a local Bureaucrat, what I had to do, to build a house? ..... and He looked at me 'sideways' , and said " You must be a Yankee ? .... just Build It !!! " ..... How Refeshing!!!!
			</p>
			<p>
			I first took a job with a Masonry Contractor in Clarksville, TN.... but I wanted to Remodel an old, Log Cabin that was on my Parent's farm, so I quit that job, and married my girlfriend from Indiana, and we started a NEW Life !!! .... I re-modeled that old cabin, and applied for a job at the Biggest Company that Erin, TN had ? ... it was called Southern Gage .... a Company that was WORLD FAMOUS, for producing Precision Thread Gages, with dimensions 'So Close' that most people can't imagine? .... Southern Gage, had ALL prospective 'New Hire's' ... Stand in the Hot, Tennessee, sun, till their name was called? .... I 'cooked' in the sun, till my name was called ... and quickly, tried to wipe the sweat from my face as I walked into the 'Interview' ? .... and THERE sat Al Magnuson ???? ... when I extended my hand in greeting? ... he just 'Sneered' and Threw a Thread Ring Gage at me !!! ..... THAT was the Final Straw ??? .... I said " That looks like a Thread Die, but it's too dull, to cut butter? " ... and I THREW it Back at Him !!!! ... AND, I intended to STOMP His Ass, or DIE Trying !!! .....but  He jumped up and said, " YOU Know what a thread die is ? " .... and I said " yeah? " .... and he said go down the end of this hallway, and tell the lady to SIGN YOU UP !!!! ..... and THAT is how I transitioned from 'Bricklayer' to a 'Precision Thread Grinder' .... and later,...... Me and Al Magnuson became Best of Friends !!! .... He was almost as, 'Scary Smart', as Moe Whittemore ?
			</p>
			<p>
			A month after My Daughter was born, in 1982 ? ... The 'Savings and Loan' Recession hit !! .... I was laid off for two years, till I managed to talk my way into a Tool & Die job, with a company that had just moved to TN ? .... I was CLUELESS about 'Metal Stamping' !!! .... but when they gave me 'The Tour of the Plant', I was AMAZED !!! ... I went home and started examining all the stuff I had in MY Home, and could NOW see, that damned , near Everything I had? ..... from door hinges, to can opener !!! ... was MADE with a DIE ? ... I got The Job !!! ... and I have been Happily, Troubleshooting Die problems, ever since ? .... I Finally, Found My True Calling !!!!

					As I recall, Jay Wilfong was the person who first introduced me
					to Moe and 700 West. I was immediately impressed
					with the audio quality and I think the first cut I heard
					out there was Ezekial Longspur's song about
					"Rolling Down the Highway."  It sounded so good that
					it was obvious this Whittemore guy knew what he was
					doing...........
					</p>
					<p>
					Shortly after that I played bass on a demo for
					Bill Jackson and Tom Mobley at 700 West. Rex Thomas also
					sat in on that one on steel. Jackson was a superb
					vocalist, and I still think he was one of the best
					I've ever been around........... Tom later got
					involved with Sequoiah, but I don't know what
					happened to Bill.......... He sang one song called
					"The Death of the Circus with No Thanks to
					Fellini" that I wish I could hear again............
					Definitely good stuff............
					</p>
					<p>
					I remember sitting on that little padded bench
					Moe had by the window in the control room and
					watching him work wonders. He was always
					lighting up a fresh batch of tobacco in his pipe, and
					his favorite past-time was making up humorous new lyrics for
					our songs. We learned so much from him about mike placement
					and ping-pong techniques for recording with limited tracks.
					</p>
					<p>
					We were really blessed to have so much talent in that place.
					The people who sat in on our album project were really
					good. Obviously, Jerry De Rome and Jay Wilfong were
					a tremendous help. Jim Moore, who was the steel
					guitarist for Bill Wilson, did a great job. We couldn't
					afford to pay the session players, but they just did it
					because they wanted to record out there. Everybody did.
					</p>
					<p>
					I remember I later tried to return the favor by playing
					bass for some other artists there. I don't recall all of the
					projects, but I do remember playing  on a single
					or two for Ed Ott.
					</p>
					<p>
					Moe invested a tremendous amount of time and patience in all
					of us. He could fix so many problems. I had a strap button let
					go  and my priceless Gibson J-50 fell on concrete one
					night. You could have dropped a golf ball through the back of
					it. Moe repaired it, and I ended up using it on the acoustic
					lead break in "I've Seen Your Face."  I still use that old Gibson
					for recording...............
					</p>
					<p>
					700 West was such a unique place to record. You could hear
					goats outside and smell Moe's coffee brewing inside. He had
					a knack for putting you at ease with his sense of humor, and
					that was really important---- especially the first few times
					you saw that red recording light go on..........
